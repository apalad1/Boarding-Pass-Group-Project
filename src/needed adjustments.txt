Just about everything is done, except the actual linking

the GUI consists of 3 forms:
1- the initial form to fill in the user info
2- the submitted form with the info they put in
3- the search form that pops up when they type an number 'id' into the initial form


1) anything that says "need help db", thats the popup searched form (#3) that needs the "need help db" strings to
    be replaced with a variable containing the dbs info on stuff like name, phone etc
    ^ found in "public void searchframepanel()"


2) 'publicpasgui()' has a 'submit_button' actionlistener below it, thats the stuff that happens when the
    submit button is pressed, name/age/phone/destination etc are all storing the .getText stuff the user filled in
    the forms. Those variables need to be sent to the db


IN SUMMARY, it needs to send the variables that are stored after the user typed in stuff to the form
when they press 'submit button' those stored variables need to be sent to the db
